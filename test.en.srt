00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,840
This programme contains some adult
themes and some strong language

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,880
SHE GASPS

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,200
Off!

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,520
Yeehah!

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,800
[Shut up!]

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,280
Argh!
Will we get far?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,920
* Aargh! *

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,880
Again!
What?!

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,000
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,800
Thank you!

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,200
Welcome to Taskmaster.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm Greg Davis and I've got some
news for you.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,960
The end is nigh,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
the penultimate episode is upon us

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,640
and what a joy it's been

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,400
to watch these pumped-up athletes
of task perform.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,400
Their skill range is
so broad that, together,

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
they're like a giant human Swiss
army knife.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,720
I'll leave you to decide which
of them is

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
the weird thing for getting stones
out of horses' hooves
