Today I want to see the most
impressive square you have made yourself.

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
And I think we should start with Karin.

3
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,560
This is a screenshot of my Strava.

4
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,800
-And it's a running app. 
-Yes, that's right.

5
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,440
So you can see which
formation you can end up running in.

6
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,120
-And what formation is that? 
-It's a square.

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,600
That was great.

8
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,280
I have been running this route five days a week-

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,000
-for the past two months to perfect..
--for the past two months to perfect...

10
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,080
-Is that true? 
-Yes. Angles and speed.

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,040
I have run outside in sleet,
snow, on ice, in wind and weather.

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,880
I fell in Kirkeveien in front of the 20-bus.

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,960
I will apologize to the lady
in Bogstadveien with a stroller.

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,440
I ran into you and screamed: "Track."

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
You got really scared, you had a child.
